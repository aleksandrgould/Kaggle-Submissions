# Kaggle-Submissions

Welcome to my personal Kaggle Submissions Repository! This repository is created to showcase my submissions and contributions to various Kaggle competitions. It serves as a centralized hub for storing code, notebooks, and relevant files related to my Kaggle journey.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized in a structured manner to maintain clarity and ease of navigation. Here's a breakdown of the main folders:

Competition Folder: Each competition has its own folder named after the competition's name. Inside this folder, you will find my submissions and related files.

Submission Folder: Within each competition folder, you will find individual submission folders named after the competition phase or my submission ID. These folders contain the code, notebooks, and any other relevant files specific to the submission.

Code: This folder holds the source code or script files used for the submission. It encompasses preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and any other necessary code.

Notebooks: If I utilized Jupyter notebooks or any other interactive notebooks, they will be placed in this folder. Notebooks provide a comprehensive explanation of my approach, including code, analysis, and visualizations.

Data: This folder contains the dataset used for the submission. It may include both the training and testing data or any additional data used during the modeling process.

README.md: Each submission folder will include a README file that explains my approach, techniques used, performance metrics, and any other relevant details. This README file provides insights into the submission and aids in understanding my methodology.

Contributions and Collaboration
While this is my personal Kaggle Submissions Repository, I am open to collaborations, discussions, and contributions from fellow Kaggle enthusiasts. If you find any of my work interesting or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to reach out or submit a pull request.
